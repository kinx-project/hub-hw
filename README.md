This repository contains the hardware design files for the kinX USB hub, a
bus-powered 4-port (2 internal, 2 external) USB hub for use within the Kinesis
Advantage keyboard in combination with the kinX keyboard controller.

The kinX USB hub is based on the Cypress HX2VL series USB controller,
specifically the [Cypress
CY7C65632-48AXCT](http://www.cypress.com/part/cy7c65632-48axct).

The design has been created with the following resources:

* [CY7C65632-48AXCT datasheet](http://www.cypress.com/file/114101/download)
* [HX2VL: Guidelines on System Design](http://www.cypress.com/file/122726/download)
* [CY4607M (CY7C65632-48AXCT devboard) schematic and BOM](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/other-resources/reduced-bom-schematic-cy7c65642-family-hx2vl-usb-20-hub-controller)
* [Example schematic for the QFN28 version](http://www.cypress.com/file/117521/download)
